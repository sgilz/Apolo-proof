For the purposes of understanding how articles are used, 
it is important to know that nouns can be either count 
(can be counted) or noncount (indefinite in quantity and cannot be counted). 
In addition, count nouns are either singular (one) or plural (more than one). 
Noncount nouns are always in singular form.
For example, if we are speaking of water that has been spilled on the table,
there can be one drop (singular) or two or more drops (plural) of water on the table.
The word drop in this example is a count noun because we can count the number of drops. 
Therefore, according to the rules applying to count nouns, 
the word drop would use the articles a or the.
However, if we are speaking of water in general spilled on the table, 
it would not be appropriate to count one water or two waters
there would simply be water on the table. Water is a noncount noun. 
Therefore, according to the rules applying to noncount nouns, 
the word water would use no article or the, but not a.
Following are the three specific rules which explain 
the use of definite and indefinite articles.
Rule #1 - Specific identity not known: Use the indefinite article 
a or an only with a singular count noun whose specific 
identity is not known to the reader. Use a before nouns 
that begin with a consonant sound, and use an before nouns 
that begin with a vowel sound.
My cousin was seeking some advice from a counselor 
(not advice in general or advice about everything, but a limited amount of advice).
I would love some coffee right now (not coffee in general, 
but a limited amount of coffee).
We might get rain tomorrow. 
Some rain would be good for the crops (a certain amount of rain, 
as opposed to rain in general).
There are some drops of water on the table (a limited number,
but more than one drop).
